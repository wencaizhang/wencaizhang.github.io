## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm WebJAM

I have a passion for all thing **Javascript**.
I enjoy building eCommerce software and stuff related to web dev.
I work mainly with **Typescript**, **React**, **Node**, **Remix**, and **NextJS**.


## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies,
and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in web development, eCommerce, and related technologies.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the minimal, lightweight, and super easy-to-customize blog starter.

  colors for better contrast
- <Twemoji emoji="man-technologist" /> Making a lot of changes to the UI, new homepage design, adding
  `ProfileCard`, `CareerTimeline` components, adding `/snippets`, `/resume` page, etc.
